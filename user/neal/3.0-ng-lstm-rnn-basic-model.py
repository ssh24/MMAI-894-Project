# # Deep Learning: Stacked LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model in Python
# Predict stock price using a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural
# Network (RNN)

# ## Part 1: Data Preprocessing
# Import required libraries
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from timeit import default_timer as timer
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model

# %matplotlib inline

# Determine prediction period
num_days_pred = 80

# Import the training set
data = pd.read_csv('0.0-sh-data-JPM.csv')

data.describe().T

# Split data into Training and Test sets
# All stock data except last 60 days
data_train = data[:(len(data) - num_days_pred)]
data_test = data[-num_days_pred:]  # Last n days of stock data

# Create a numpy array of 1 column that we care about - Adj Open Stock Price
training_set = data_train.iloc[:, 8:9].values

# Get the real Opening stock prices for the last n days
real_stock_price = data_test.iloc[:, 8:9].values

# Feature Scaling
# With RNNs it is recommended to apply normalization for feature scaling
sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1),
                  copy=True)

# Scale the training set
training_set_scaled = sc.fit_transform(training_set)

# Create a data structure with n timesteps and 1 output (use the previous
# n days' stock prices to predict the next output = 3 months of prices)
X_train = []
y_train = []

for i in range(num_days_pred, len(data_train)):

    # append the previous n days' stock prices
    X_train.append(training_set_scaled[i - num_days_pred:i, 0])

    # predict the stock price on the next day
    y_train.append(training_set_scaled[i, 0])

# Convert X_train and y_train to numpy arrays

# Reshape the data to add additional indicators (e.g. volume, closing price, etc.)
# if needed (currently only predicting opening price)

                      1))  # number of input layers (currently only opening price)

# Part 2: Build the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model
# Import the required Keras libraries and packages

# Add a timer

# Initialize the RNN

               input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))

# Add a 2nd LSTM layer with Dropout regularization
model.add(LSTM(units=num_days_pred,  # number of memory cells (neurons) in this layer
               return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(rate=learning_rate))

# Add a 3rd LSTM layer with Dropout regularization
model.add(LSTM(units=num_days_pred,  # number of memory cells (neurons) in this layer
               return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(rate=learning_rate))

# Add a 4th (and last) LSTM layer with Dropout regularization
# number of memory cells (neurons) in this layer
model.add(LSTM(units=num_days_pred))
model.add(Dropout(rate=learning_rate))

# Add the output layer
model.add(Dense(units=1))

# Compile the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mean_squared_error')

# Fit the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to the Training Set
model.fit(x=X_train,
          y=y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=epochs)

# Elapsed time in minutes
end = timer()

print(0.1 * round((end - start) / 6))

# Add an end of work message
